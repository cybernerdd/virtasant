# Virtasant Secret Sharing App

Welcome to the Virtasant Secret Sharing App! This document will guide you through the setup process, including installing dependencies, starting the development server, and building the project for production.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

•⁠  ⁠*Node.js (LTS version 20.x or later)*: You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
•⁠  ⁠*npm (comes with Node.js)*: Ensure that npm is installed along with Node.js.

## Project Setup

1.⁠ ⁠*Clone the Repository*  
   ⁠ git clone https://github.com/cybernerdd/virtasant.git ⁠

2.⁠ ⁠*Navigate to the Project Directory*  
   ⁠ Backend: cd backend ⁠
    Frontend: cd frontend

3.⁠ ⁠*Install Dependencies*  
   ⁠ npm install ⁠

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, use the following command:

 Backend: npm start
⁠ Frontend: npm run serve ⁠

This will start a local development server, accessible at ⁠ http://localhost:8080/ 

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, use the following command:

⁠ npm run build ⁠

This will create a ⁠ dist ⁠ directory containing the compiled files. These files can be deployed to your production server.

## Linting and Formatting

To lint and format your code, you can run:

⁠ npm run lint ⁠

This will check your code for any linting errors and help maintain code consistency across the project.

## Node.js Version

The project is developed and tested using *Node.js LTS version 16.x*. Ensure you're using a compatible version of Node.js for the best results.

You can check your current Node.js version by running:

⁠ node -v ⁠

If you need to switch Node.js versions, consider using a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
